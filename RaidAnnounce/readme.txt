How you use it (no reload needed)

/raidimport → paste your export (either MyRaidData = { ... } or return { ... }) → Apply (no reload).

Announce:

/raidannounce tanks
/raidannounce ai
/raidannounce fort
/raidannounce sp
/raidannounce heals
/raidannounce kicks
/raidannounce tranq
/raidannounce fear
/raidannounce all rw (raid warning if you’re lead/assist)

If anything prints only — Header —, it means that section of MyRaidData is empty or shaped oddly—paste me that subsection and I’ll tweak the normalizer.
